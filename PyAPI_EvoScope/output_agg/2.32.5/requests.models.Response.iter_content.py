        request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for
        large responses.  The chunk size is the number of bytes it should
        read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
        returned as decoding can take place.

        chunk_size must be of type int or None. A value of None will
        function differently depending on the value of `stream`.
        stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
        chunks are received. If stream=False, data is returned as
        a single chunk.

        If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best
        available encoding based on the response.
