        """Build the PoolKey attributes used by urllib3 to return a connection.

        This looks at the PreparedRequest, the user-specified verify value,
        and the value of the cert parameter to determine what PoolKey values
        to use to select a connection from a given urllib3 Connection Pool.

        The SSL related pool key arguments are not consistently set. As of
        this writing, use the following to determine what keys may be in that
        dictionary:

        * If ``verify`` is ``True``, ``"ssl_context"`` will be set and will be the
          default Requests SSL Context
        * If ``verify`` is ``False``, ``"ssl_context"`` will not be set but
          ``"cert_reqs"`` will be set
        * If ``verify`` is a string, (i.e., it is a user-specified trust bundle)
          ``"ca_certs"`` will be set if the string is not a directory recognized
          by :py:func:`os.path.isdir`, otherwise ``"ca_cert_dir"`` will be
          set.
        * If ``"cert"`` is specified, ``"cert_file"`` will always be set. If
          ``"cert"`` is a tuple with a second item, ``"key_file"`` will also
          be present

        To override these settings, one may subclass this class, call this
        method and use the above logic to change parameters as desired. For
        example, if one wishes to use a custom :py:class:`ssl.SSLContext` one
        must both set ``"ssl_context"`` and based on what else they require,
        alter the other keys to ensure the desired behaviour.

        :param request:
            The PreparedReqest being sent over the connection.
        :type request:
            :class:`~requests.models.PreparedRequest`
        :param verify:
            Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether
            we verify the server's TLS certificate, or a string, in which case it
            must be a path to a CA bundle to use.
        :param cert:
            (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate for client
            authentication (a.k.a., mTLS). This may be a string (i.e., just
            the path to a file which holds both certificate and key) or a
            tuple of length 2 with the certificate file path and key file
            path.
        :returns:
            A tuple of two dictionaries. The first is the "host parameters"
            portion of the Pool Key including scheme, hostname, and port. The
            second is a dictionary of SSLContext related parameters.
